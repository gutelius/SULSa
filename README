ABOUT
=======

SULSa (Swift User Location Services App) was created to allow programmers and developers to easily add the location info of users to their POST requests to Ushahdi.  The location information is updated monthly from http://www.hostip.info to a server managed by Ushahidi to ensure it never goes offline permanently.  This early service for location information will grow with Ushahidi/Swift and allow the development team to offer documentation on how to pull and push user location from reports as XML, JSON as well as incorporating the emerging EDXL and PFIF standards.

Developers - Moses Mugisha, Jon Gosier
